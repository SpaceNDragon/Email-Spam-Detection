# Email Spam Detection

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You have selected a text snippet from a notebook that introduces you to the basic of mechine learning using the SMS Spam Collection Dataset. This dataset contain information about the Spam and Ham messages.https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=1e25c2fb80a4e995JmltdHM9MTY5MjMxNjgwMCZpZ3VpZD0zM2NlMTI5OS0wM2Y3LTY2NTctMzVlNi0wMWY4MDI2YzY3ZjUmaW5zaWQ9NTc3MA&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=33ce1299-03f7-6657-35e6-01f8026c67f5&u=a1L2ltYWdlcy9zZWFyY2g_cT1zbXMgbG9nbyBpbiB3aW5kb3dzIGtleWJvYXJkJkZPUk09SVFGUkJBJmlkPTAxREFFRkFBQkEyQzRDQjlBQzQzNEYzRjA0RDE0NUU1MUFBQkNGMjI&ntb=1 Spam and Ham Dataset is a collection of text messages that are labeled as either spam or ham (non-spam).
Spam messages are usually unsolicited, unwanted, or fraudulent messages that are sent for commercial or malicious purposes. Ham messages are legitimate, personal, or relevant messages that are sent by genuine senders.

In this notebook, you will learn how to:

Load and explore the dataset using Python Visualize the data using histograms, CountVectorizer, classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, Train and Test various machine learning algorithms such as MLPClassifier, Multinomial NB, Bernoulli NB. Compare the accuracy of different models, Make predictions for new observations using the best model This notebook is a great way to get started with machine learning and understand some of the key concepts and techniques. You will also get to practice your coding skills in Python, popular languages for data analysis and visualization. ðŸ’»

The spam and ham dataset can be used for the purpose of spam classification, 
which is a task of identifying and filtering out spam messages from a given set of text messages.
